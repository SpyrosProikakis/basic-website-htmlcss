We chose the creation of a travel guide and implemented our website, using html and css, based on the knowledge we have gained from the laboratory lectures of the course and from our personal search on the internet. Our work includes a menu, which lists the contents of our travel guide and from which the visitor can discover everything he needs for a complete trip to the island of Rhodes.
